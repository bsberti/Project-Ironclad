# Development Log

## Project Ironclad

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Purpose of This Document

This document serves as the development journal for Project Ironclad. It
records daily and weekly progress, technical decisions, problems
encountered, and solutions implemented.

This devlog is both: - A production tracking tool\
- A portfolio artifact demonstrating engineering process, iteration, and
problem-solving

All major architectural changes, system designs, and scope decisions
should be logged here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How to Use This Devlog

Each entry should include:

-   **Date / Sprint / Milestone**
-   **Goals for the session**
-   **What was completed**
-   **Technical details**
-   **Problems encountered**
-   **Solutions / Decisions**
-   **Next actions**

This format supports: - Clear iteration history\
- Interview discussion material\
- Portfolio write-ups

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Development Workflow

The project follows a Kanban workflow using GitHub Projects:

1.  Backlog is reviewed at the start of each session\
2.  Tasks are moved to *In Progress*\
3.  Completed tasks are moved to *Done*\
4.  This devlog is updated to reflect work performed

Each devlog entry should reference the corresponding tasks when
applicable.

# Best Practices

-   Keep entries concise but technical\
-   Document *why* decisions were made\
-   Capture architectural changes immediately\
-   Include performance considerations when relevant\
-   Reference specific systems, classes, or files when possible

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Portfolio Usage

This devlog will later be used to: - Write postmortems\
- Prepare technical interviews\
- Populate portfolio case studies\
- Demonstrate professional development habits
