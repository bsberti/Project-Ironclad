# Project Ironclad  
**Third-Person Action Combat Prototype (Unreal Engine 5, C++)**

---

## Overview

Project Ironclad is a third-person action combat prototype developed in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. The project is built as a flagship portfolio piece focused on responsive weapon-based combat, enemy AI, and modular gameplay systems.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate professional-level gameplay programming, real-time systems architecture, and Unreal Engine C++ workflows aligned with modern game development practices.

This is a systems-driven prototype: scope is intentionally limited to prioritize combat feel, technical depth, and production-quality implementation.
